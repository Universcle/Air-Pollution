# Air Quality Analysis Web App

This project is a Flask-based web application for analyzing air quality data through classification, regression, and clustering techniques. The app allows users to interactively select features, classifiers, or regression methods to generate predictions and visualize results.

## Features

- **Classification**: Perform air quality classification using various algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes).
- **Regression**: Generate regression surfaces to predict air quality metrics using algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge, and Random Forest.
- **Clustering**: Perform K-means clustering on air quality data and visualize clusters on feature axes.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time ROC curves, regression surfaces, and clustering scatter plots.
